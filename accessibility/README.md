With this article, our goal is to introduce fellow engineers, regardless of level, to web accessibility and share our practical knowledge and best practices.
One good example for accessibility is if you can use your website without looking at it.
By the W3C definition, accessibility means that websites, tools, and technologies are designed and developed so that people with disabilities can use them. More specifically, people can: perceive, understand, navigate, and interact with the Web, and contribute to the Web.Why Accessibility is Often Neglected
While there are many reasons why accessibility is not omnipresent, although ideally it should be, there are three reasons that stick out.

First, it’s hard to accommodate for something that you don’t understand well. Most of the time, it is not motivation that we lack, but rather education on how disabilities prevent people from interacting with our website. This includes lack of knowledge around what disability types exist and how to accommodate them. We just do not know the ins and outs of the problem.

Second, making your application accessible requires a lot of work. Starting from understanding the premises of the standards you need to follow all the way to designing the needed features and functionalities into your app. Then of course, there’s testing whether your approach has yielded the desired result – and much of the testing can only be done manually. The practices described in this article will make this effort easier, but we are still talking about a serious undertaking.

Third is the economic argument which, rightly or not, dominates modern decision making: in most cases, a minority of your clients (or users) would be affected by a disability, which serves as justification to postpone implementing those accessibility improvements for the next release. It’s far easier for a business to justify focusing effort on something that benefits the majority rather than serving a smaller subset of users with improvements that may feel like the application did not actually move forward.

Why Accessibility is Important
It's worth taking some time to consider the benefits of building accessible websites because it's a difficult and time-consuming, therefore costly, undertaking. However, there are solid reasons to be doing it.
