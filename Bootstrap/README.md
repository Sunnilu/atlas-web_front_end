Welcome to BOOTSTRAP


What is Bootstrap?  Well for me it's been a good experience learning how to use the Bootstrap library to create CSS built-ins in an easier format.  I think this project opened a door for smaller projects or one pagers.

What I have learned so far-Bootstrap is a powerful, feature-packed frontend toolkit, you can build anything from protoype to production- in minutes.

Bootstraps also has a production ready CSS and JS via CDN without the need for a build step.

JS components
this is a list of general page structures:
Alerts for dismissing
buttons for toggling states and checkbox/radio functionality
carousel for all slide behaviors, controls, and indicators
Collapse for toggling visibility of content
Dropdowns for displaying and positioning 
Modals for displaying, positioning, and scroll hehavior
Navbar for extending our collapse and offcanvas plugins to implement responsive behaviors.
Navs with the Tab plugin for toggling content panes.
Offcanvases for displaying, positioning, and scroll behavior
Scrollspy for scroll behavior and navigation updates
Toasts for displaying and dismissing
Tooltips and popevers for displaying and positioning(also requires Popper)

Important globals
Bootstrap employs a handful of important global styles and settings, all of which are almost exclusively geared towards the normalization of cross browser styles.

HTML5 doctype
Bootstrap requires the use of the HTML5 doctype.
