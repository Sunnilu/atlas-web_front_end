the first thing I learned about JavaScript was how to display the date and time.  What a button was on JS, the onclick and demo.


<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>

<h2>My First JavaScript</h2>

<button type="button"
onclick="document.getElementById('demo').innerHTML = Date()">
Click me to display Date and Time.</button>

<p id="demo"></p>

</body>
</html> 



Javascript being one of three languages that a developer must learn- HTML and CSS being the others.  JavaScript is used to program the behavoior of the web pages.  

I received some valuable information about working with JS, the only way to become a clever programmer is to : Practice. Then practice some more, code, code, code!
